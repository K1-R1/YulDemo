# YulDemo

This repo contains some Yul examples from the solidity documentation.

### Yul
From the solidity documentaion:

`Yul (previously also called JULIA or IULIA) is an intermediate language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends.
Support for EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5 and Ewasm is planned, and it is designed to be a usable common denominator of all three platforms. It can already be used in stand-alone mode and for “inline assembly” inside Solidity and there is an experimental implementation of the Solidity compiler that uses Yul as an intermediate language. Yul is a good target for high-level optimisation stages that can benefit all target platforms equally.`
